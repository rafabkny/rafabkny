### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,
I am **Rafael** (aka Configutron Prime), a leading **Product Management Generalist** you probably haven't met yet. My happy place is the part of the development cycle where I get to work with developers and turn product requirements into usable features.

:shipit: I know WE ALL LIVE for the moment we get to SHIP TO PRODUCTION... but do you love the painful process of getting there?</br> 
I know you don't but <b>I DO</b>!

<p>
:floppy_disk: <b>CODE STACKS</b></br>
I've worked on the development of a web-based SaaS Health Care platform and a CRM application using these languages:
<ul>
<li>Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Angular</li>
<li>C#/.NET, Node.js, SQL Server, React JS</li>
</ul>  
</p>

<p>
:zap: <b>INTEGRATIONS</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Twilio</b> (SMS, MMS & Broadcast web-based messaging services)</li>
<li><b>SendGrid</b> (Transactional and Marketing email services)</li>
<li><b>Bee Plugin</b> (Email Design)</li>
<li><b>FlatFile</b> (Data imports)</li>
</ul>  
</p>

<p>
:link:<b>CONFIGURATION</b></br>
I spent several years building out a Suite of Configuration tools, first in JSON and then JSON and YAML. I take notes in YAML using a text editor. If I like your app I will likely look at all your pretty JSON calls. If numbers are your thing; I made <b>1,004 contributions in 2018</b>.</br>
<ul>
<li>JSON</li>
<li>YAML</li>
</ul>  
</p>
<p>
:cloud: <b>INFRASTUCTURE SERVICES</b>
<ul>
<li>AWS</li>
<li>cloud: Azude DevOps</li>
</ul>  
</p>
