### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,
I am **Rafael** (aka Configutron Prime), the best **Product Management Generalist** you probably haven't met yet. My happy place is the part of the development cycle where I get to work with developers and turn product requirements into usable features.

:shipit: I know WE ALL LIVE for the moment we get to SHIP TO PRODUCTION... but do you love the painful process of getting there?</br> 
I know you don't but <b>I DO!</b>

<p>
<b>CODE STACKS</b></br>
I've worked on the development of a web-based SaaS Health Care platform and a CRM application using these languages:</br>
</br>
:floppy_disk: Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Angular</br>
:floppy_disk: C#/.NET, Node.js, SQL Server, React JS</br>
</p>

<p>
<b>INTEGRATIONS</b></br>
:zap: <b>Twilio</b> (SMS, MMS & Broadcast web-based messaging services)</br>
:zap: <b>SendGrid</b> (Transactional and Marketing email services)</br>
:zap: <b>Bee Plugin</b> (Email Design)</br>
:zap: <b>FlatFile</b> (Data imports)</br>
</p>

<p>
<b>CONFIGURATION</b></br>
I spent several years building out a Suite of Configuration tools, first in JSON and then JSON and YAML. I take notes using a text editor in YAML Syntax. If I like your app I will likely look at all your pretty JSON calls. If numbersare your thing; I made <b>1,004 contributions in 2018</b></br>
</br>
