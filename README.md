### Hi there 👋,
I am **Rafael** (aka Configutron), the best **Product Management Generalist** you probably haven't met yet. My happy place is the part of the development cycle where I get to work with developers and turn product requirements into usable features.

:shipit: I know WE ALL LIVE for the moment we get to SHIP TO PRODUCTION... but do you love the painful process of getting there?</br> 
I know you don't but **I DO** :rage1:
