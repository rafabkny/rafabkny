### Hi there ðŸ‘‹,
I am Rafael (aka Configutron), the best Product Management Generalist you probably haven't met yet. Feel free to say hello. 
My happy place is the part of the development cycle where I get to work with developers and turn product requirements turn into usable features.

YES! I know WE ALL LIVE for the moment we get to SHIP TO PRODUCTION... but do you love the painful process of getting there?</br> 
I know you don't but I know that I DO :rage1:
